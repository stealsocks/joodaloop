<h1> Useful </h1>
<p> Tools and stuff that I recommend. </p>

<h2>Software:</h2>
<p><a>Bear</a>: My text editor of choice. A minimal but full-featured markdown editor that does pleasant things like detect links in your clipboard and uses a lightweight tagging system. I would pay for the Pro version but I've I like working offline and have been burnt by sync problems on other writing apps enough that I prefer my editors asynchronous.  </p>

<p> <a>Rectangle</a>: A window manager for MacOS. </p>

<p> <a>Hugo</a>: It would be worth it just for the speed, but it's also the simplest, most customizable option I've tried. There's never been a moment where I've wished for a feature and found it lacking. Both 100songs and are built with Hugo. The only reason this site isn't is because I thought there was sentamentality in handcrafting the whole thing. I've heard <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com">Pelican</a> is cool too though.</p>

<p> <a>Fish</a>: Command-line autocomplete that just works.  </p>
